# Pironman Tutorial

## Setup config.txt

You need to setup config.txt to enable I2C and SPI.

> This only works for Home Assistant OS, running on Raspberry Pi. Not for Home Assistant Container. Which means this only support for the os install on Raspbberry Pi. Not for the docker container.

You will need:

 - SD card reader
 - SD card with Home Assistant Operating System flashed on it

Shutdown/turn-off your Home Assistant installation and unplug the SD card. Plug the SD card into an SD card reader and find a drive/file system named `hassos-boot`. The file system might be shown/mounted automatically. If not, use your operating systems disk management utility to find the SD card reader and make sure the first partition is available.

- In the root of the `hassos-boot` partition, **add a new folder called** `CONFIG`.
- In the `CONFIG` folder, **add another new folder called** `modules`.
- Inside the `modules` folder, **add a text file called** `rpi-i2c.conf` with the following content:
  ```
  i2c-dev
  ```
- In the root of the `hassos-boot` partition, **edit the file called** `config.txt` **add four lines** to it:
   ```
   dtparam=i2c_vc=on
   dtparam=i2c_arm=on
   dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpio_pin=26,active_low=0
   dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=13
   ```
- To enable RGB, selected one driver and make sure you set up the main board respectivly. continue editing the `config.txt` file:
  > Earlier version of pironman only have one driver, PWM(GPIO12).
  - For PWM(GPIO12), it use audio to drive the led, so turn off the audio.
    ```
    dtparam=audio=off
    ```
  - For SPI(GPIO10), it use spi to drive the led, so turn on the spi, set core freq to 500. Enable audio if you need it.
    ```
    dtparam=spi=on
    core_freq=500
    core_freq_min=500
    # Enable audio if you need it.
    dtparam=audio=on
    ```
  - For PCM(GPIO21), it use PCM to drive the led, it doesn't need to set anything. But it will interfer with I2S device, so make sure you disable them, like hifiberry-dac or i2s-mmap. Enable audio if you need it.
    ```
    # Enable audio if you need it.
    dtparam=audio=on
    # Comment out the i2s device.
    # dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
    # dtoverlay=i2s-mmap
    ```
- Eject the SD card and plug it back into your Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
